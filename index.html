        <p>Utah contains the Great Salt Lake and parts of the middle Rocky Mountains and Uinta Mountains. The western
            third of the
            state is a broad desertlike area. About 70% of the land is owned by either the federal or the state
            government. The
            region was inhabited as early as 10,000 bce.</p>
